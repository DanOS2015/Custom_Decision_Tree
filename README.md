# Custom_Decision_Tree
This is a custom decision tree algorithm I made in Python to help me better understand machine learning. This is a classification algorithm that uses a gini index criterion. The dataset I am using is one I accquired off Kaggle.com. The dataset is titled "HR Analytics" and I use it to try and predict employee turnover. It outputs the algorithm's prediction accuracy, as well as what the prediction was for each input in the test set and what the actually value was.
