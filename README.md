# Custom_Decision_Tree
This is a custom decision tree algorithm I made in Python to help me better understand machine learning. This is a classification algorithm that uses a gini index criterion. The dataset I am using is one I accquired off Kaggle.com. The dataset is titled "HR Analytics" and I use it to try and predict employee turnover.
